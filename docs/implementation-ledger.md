# Construct Implementation Ledger

This file tracks the implementation phases, current status, shipped scope, and verification state for Construct.

## Baseline

- Repository initialized from a single README-only commit.
- Product name locked to `Construct`.
- Workspace/tooling direction: `pnpm` + `Turborepo`.
- Future agent stack direction is fixed: `LangGraph` orchestration with provider selection controlled by the development team, not by end users in the product UI.

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Repo & boilerplate | Implemented | Monorepo scaffold, Electron desktop shell, runner service, root scripts, and workspace configs are in place. |
| 1 | Shared schemas & canonical sample project | Implemented | Shared schemas, blueprint validation script, real workflow runtime sample project, and Jest tests are in place. |
| 2 | File manager & snapshotting | Implemented | Workspace-scoped file IO and a separate internal git snapshot store now exist in the runner, with restore coverage for edits, creations, and deletions. |
| 3 | Test runner & adapters | Implemented | Adapter-based task execution now runs targeted Jest tests in child processes with timeouts, structured task results, and a runner endpoint for blueprint step execution. |
| 4 | Editor UI basics & anchor navigation | Implemented | The Electron renderer now loads blueprint metadata, renders a Monaco editor and file tree, opens real workspace files, and jumps to `TASK:` anchors for selected steps. |
| 5 | Learning Surface & Guidance Console | Implemented | Each unit now opens in a technical brief with quick checks, then transitions into a focused execution mode with a persistent guidance console, deterministic hints, and targeted task submission. |
| 6 | Task lifecycle & telemetry | Implemented | Pre-task snapshots, persisted task attempts, learner-model updates, telemetry submission, renderer-side task lifecycle wiring, and the compact native IDE shell pass are in place. |
| 7 | Edit tracking & anti-cheat | Implemented | Typed-versus-pasted telemetry is enforced through a rewrite gate, and the learner now works inside a materialized starter workspace where internal step tests stay hidden from the explorer. |
| 8 | Live Guide orchestration & LLM integration | In progress | Real agent foundations are now live: LangGraph job orchestration, the LangChain OpenAI provider, Tavily-backed research, SSE activity streaming, prompt compaction for structured plan generation, runtime Guide responses, first-slice generated blueprint synthesis, and agent persistence for planning state, learner knowledge, active blueprint metadata, generated blueprint records, and dashboard-ready project summaries. When `DATABASE_URL` is configured, those records are stored through Prisma on Postgres/Neon; otherwise Construct falls back to local state files. Blueprint creation now also writes a live build/event/stage record with resumable answers and a debug-mode inspector surface for deep project-creation observability. Dynamic plan mutation after runtime struggle is still pending. |
| 9 | Architect static generator | Pending | Not started. |
| 10 | Rollback UX & snapshot management | Pending | Not started. |
| 11 | Multi-language adapters | Pending | Not started. |
| 12 | Dynamic plan mutation & persistence | Pending | Not started. |
| 13 | E2E validation | Pending | Not started. |

## Current Changeset Scope

- Replace the previously hardcoded planner path with a real agent runtime in the runner.
- Add a real homepage/dashboard that lists persisted projects, shows in-progress and recent work, and resumes the selected project back into its stored step.
- Add provider-controlled OpenAI integration through the LangChain OpenAI provider with structured outputs and `gpt-5.4` as the current default planning model.
- Add Tavily-backed architecture research behind a swappable search-provider boundary.
- Add LangGraph-backed planning/runtime graphs for question generation, personalized roadmap generation, and live runtime guidance.
- Add SSE job streaming so the renderer can show what the agent is doing while it researches and plans.
- Add detailed runner-side agent logging so the server logs mirror job lifecycle, stage events, research activity, model invocations, and completion or failure summaries.
- Add first-slice agent-generated blueprint synthesis so planning now produces a canonical project directory, masked learner files, hidden tests, and step docs/checks that the app can load directly.
- Replace the fixed runtime sample as the always-active workspace by letting the runner resolve and materialize the latest generated blueprint on demand.
- Remove the silent startup fallback to the fixed sample blueprint so the desktop app opens in planning mode until an agent-generated blueprint exists.
- Persist a user knowledge base derived from prior planning sessions and feed it back into future question generation and roadmap synthesis.
- Add an agent persistence boundary so planning sessions, learner knowledge, active generated-project selection, and generated blueprint records are stored as user data.
- Replace the raw SQL Neon persistence path with a Prisma-backed persistence layer that maps onto the existing backend tables and stores project metadata, current-step progress, and active-project selection per user.
- Use Postgres/Neon as the remote backing store for that user data when `DATABASE_URL` is configured, while keeping the runnable local project workspace on disk.
- Open the desktop app in a fresh new-project intake by default, even when a generated blueprint already exists, so the user can always start a new Architect run first and only resume an existing workspace intentionally.
- Expand the Architect planning flow from a single research hop into a multi-stage LangGraph with separate research passes for project shape, prerequisite skills, dependency order, and validation strategy before synthesis.
- Add explicit user-facing blueprint materialization stages so Construct shows when it is creating the project layout, writing support files, writing canonical files, generating hidden tests, packaging masked learner tasks, preparing dependencies, and activating the workspace.
- Add a best-effort generated-project dependency installation hook with runner-side logging and warning states when install preparation fails.
- Add `CONSTRUCT_DEBUG_LEVEL` so developer-facing runner logs can scale from quiet to full trace, with level `3` logging raw model prompts and payload text/object output for agent debugging.
- Add token-stream plumbing from the LangChain OpenAI provider into runner-side SSE events so long Architect and Guide generations can show live partial model output instead of appearing frozen.
- Replace the flat planning event log with a grouped Architect task board so users can see distinct work streams like research, plan synthesis, file writing, hidden-test generation, dependency setup, and workspace activation while streamed model output arrives live.
- Add an explicit Architect scope-analysis pass before research so the agent itself can describe the request’s scope in freeform terms and set numeric planning bounds, instead of being forced into canned scope categories.
- Replace the hardcoded intake answer choices with Architect-generated per-question options, and resolve submitted answers back into full question-plus-selected-option context before plan and blueprint generation.
- Tighten Architect intake so each question produces exactly 3 agent-generated options, while the UI adds a separate custom-answer path that sends the learner’s freeform response into later Architect calls with the original question and full option context.
- Change blueprint steps from a single prose brief into a lesson-first format with markdown concept slides, quiz checks before implementation, and a task brief that is supposed to be solvable from the prior teaching content.
- Add a runtime deep-dive mutation path so, after repeated failure, the Guide can request the Architect to rewrite the active step with extra lesson slides and additional checks before the learner retries the task.
- Change the lesson surface from a small brief panel into a full-page course flow: cover page first, then full-screen explanation slides, then full-screen checks, then an explicit implementation handoff into the code workspace.
- Stop auto-opening the learner code file right after blueprint generation so the learner lands in the lesson/course flow first and only enters Monaco when the exercise handoff begins.
- Persist live blueprint-build state, stage snapshots, and append-only agent events during project creation so the latest generated plan/draft/files are inspectable and resumable after failure or app restart.
- Add a debug-mode blueprint inspector route plus runner APIs that expose build summaries, deep build detail, live event streaming, captured files/tests, and LangSmith project metadata for project-creation observability.
- Replace free-form file maps in the generated-blueprint schema with explicit `{ path, content }` arrays so OpenAI Structured Outputs accepts the blueprint contract during Architect generation.
- Expand schema-compatibility fallback detection so invalid response-format schema errors also trigger JSON fallback instead of immediately failing the Architect run.
- Replace static “Ask guide” behavior with a real runtime Guide request that analyzes the current anchored code, constraints, and latest task result.
- Strengthen the Architect lesson-generation instructions so the first lesson is concept-first, explanation-heavy, and tightly scoped to the requested artifact instead of drifting into setup-heavy or validation-only steps.

- Passed: learner-workspace sanity check confirmed the visible explorer surface excludes `tests/` and the materialized [`/Users/abhinavmishra/solin/socrates/blueprints/workflow-runtime/.construct/workspaces/construct.workflow-runtime.v1/src/state.ts`](/Users/abhinavmishra/solin/socrates/blueprints/workflow-runtime/.construct/workspaces/construct.workflow-runtime.v1/src/state.ts) contains the starter `throw new Error('Implement mergeState')` implementation instead of the canonical solved code.
- Note: the default shell runtime in this workspace still points at Node `v20.19.5`, so Phase 7 verification currently relies on switching to a newer local Node with `node:sqlite` support.
- Not run in this sandbox: a bind-based smoke test for the HTTP endpoint, because local listen attempts from the test process hit `EPERM`.
- Pending: `pnpm dev` smoke check for the Electron app and runner.

## Blockers

- Construct now emits a first-slice generated blueprint bundle for arbitrary goals, but the output quality still depends on a single Architect generation pass and does not yet include project execution smoke tests of the generated artifact before activation.
- The Architect graph now uses multiple research stages, but blueprint generation is still a single synthesis pass after those stages; it relies on prompt quality rather than a separate critique-and-repair subgraph before activation.
- Dependency installation is currently best-effort and manifest-driven (`package.json` via `pnpm`, `Cargo.toml` via `cargo fetch`). It is surfaced clearly in the UI and logs, but Construct does not yet branch into repair flows when install/setup fails.
- The real agent stack requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY` in the runner environment. Provider choice remains developer-controlled through environment configuration, not end-user UI.
- Prisma-backed persistence requires `DATABASE_URL` in the runner environment. The current implementation stores planning state, learner knowledge, active blueprint metadata, generated blueprint records, project summaries, and current-step resume state in Postgres/Neon when configured, but still keeps runnable project files and task-lifecycle SQLite state local on disk because execution stays local-first.

## Next Phase

Continue Phase 8 by hardening the new generated-blueprint path: improve prompt examples and generation reliability, run pre-activation smoke tests on generated projects, and start persisting runtime step mutations back into the active blueprint instead of treating it as fixed after generation. After that, add deeper per-user project analytics and richer dashboard filtering on top of the new Prisma-backed project metadata.
